## Introduction
Fung.Info is a mobile application that uses AI and image recognition to identify fungi species from images, helping users distinguish between edible and poisonous varieties during outdoor activities.

## Executive Summary
Our project introduces an innovative solution to the challenge of identifying fungi in the wild. By leveraging AI and image recognition, our app allows users to quickly and accurately identify fungi species using their device's camera.

## Project Origin
Our team identified a need for a tool that could help outdoor enthusiasts and mushroom farmers identify whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous. The app also provides information about the identified mushroom species and potential culinary uses.

## Project Scope & Deliverables

- Build a mobile application (Android) that can detect mushroom species and determine if they are edible or poisonous.
### Deliverables:
- Building a system that can identify mushroom species
- Provides insight into mushroom species
- Delivering user friendly, and reliable mobile application
- Seamless integration between system components
### Scope:
### In-Scope:
- Mushroom species detection based on images
- Mushroom species awareness
- First aid for mushroom poisoning
### Out-of-Scope:
